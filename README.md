# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Aryan Sharma**, a sophomore at **Purdue University** majoring in **Agricultural Systems Management** (College of Agricultural and Biological Engineering).

I enjoy building real-world systems — practical, full-stack tools that automate operations, optimize workflows, and simplify decision-making for people who need things *done*.

### ⚒️ What I build
- Lightweight admin panels for financial and operational management
- Automation tools to simplify repetitive business tasks
- Data-driven dashboards that non-tech users can actually use
- Systems that scale without getting bloated
